# Heat Equation Solver using Ferrite.jl

This repository contains a simple heat equation solver implemented in Julia using the Ferrite.jl library. The solver generates a 2D grid, defines boundary conditions, assembles the global stiffness matrix and force vector, and solves for the temperature distribution.

## Requirements

1. Install Julia from [Julia's official website](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
2. Add the required packages by running the following commands in the Julia REPL:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Ferrite")
Pkg.add("SparseArrays")
```


### This is the hello world equivalent of the ferrite.jl library.
